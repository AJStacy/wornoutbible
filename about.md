Hi. I'm Andrew Stacy and I'm a follower of Christ. This is the primary trait that defines me and impacts everything I do. I am also a professional web developer and love working with technology.

What you will find here are blog posts about my experiences with God's word. I like to write down my thoughts and I thought it would
be fun to share them with others.

I would highly encourage anyone who reads my blog posts to filter what I say through your own personal prayer and through other Christians you trust (like your local pastor). I am not a theologian. I am not a pastor. I am just a dude that loves Jesus and wants to share my thoughts.

With that said, I try to take great care to not write anything unorthodox or heretical and I align most of my beliefs with Sovereign Grace Ministries. Sovereign Grace is a denomination that believes in reformed theology and is continuationist. We believe in thorough theology but we also believe that the Holy Spirit is alive and at work in us today and gives believers spiritual gifts for the edification of the body.

Hopefully this gives you some insight as to where I'm coming from. I hope you enjoy what you read.
